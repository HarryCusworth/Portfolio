					<p class="profileBody"> After completing my academic studies, I wanted to put my research skills to good use and worked with a number of organisation whose work focused on young people’s mental health and the importance of play. This taught me the importance of research in shaping policy and I am confident my work has had knock on effects on government policy in the UK.</p>

<p class="profileBody">I became increasingly familiar with charity sector funding infrastructure and realised that funding applications for excellent projects often failed because of lack of access to up to date data. In response to this I started a consultancy business that prepares tailored ‘tool-boxes’ of useful data that charities can easily draw on during bid writing.</p>

<p class="profileBody">However, the more familiar I got with the funding ecosystem, the more I saw how often it choked good ideas, stifled solutions and forced organisations to waste precious resources jumping through hoops. The Covid pandemic only exacerbated this problem by further fragmenting the funding pool.</p>

<p class="profileBody">I felt that by learning to code I would have the skills to develop simple, real world tools that would speak to these same problems the charities were struggling hard to address without being so reliant on external funding sources. I am motivated by the belief that technology can provide cheap and effective interventions against the inequalities in society.</p>
