						Career Profile</div>
					
					<p class="profileBody"> After completing my academic studies, I wanted to put my research skills to good use. I began working with  organisation whose work focused on young people’s mental health and the importance of play where I learnt the importance of research in shaping policy and I am confident my work has had knock on effects on government policy in the UK.</p>

<p class="profileBody">As I became increasingly familiar with charity sector funding infrastructure I realised how often funding applications for excellent projects fail because of lack of access to up to date data. In response to this I started a consultancy business that prepares tailored ‘tool-boxes’ of useful quotes and statistics that charities can easily draw on during bid writing.</p>

<p class="profileBody">However, the more I engaged with the funding ecosystem, the more I saw how often it choked good ideas, stifled solutions and forced organisations to waste precious resources jumping through hoops. The Covid pandemic only exacerbated this problem by further fragmenting  funding pools.</p>

<p class="profileBody">I felt that by learning to code I would have the skills to develop simple, real world tools that would speak to these same problems charities were struggling hard to address without being so reliant on external funding sources. I am motivated by the belief that technology can provide cheap and effective interventions against the inequalities in society.</p>
